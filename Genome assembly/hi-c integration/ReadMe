### Here contains the pipeline to run Hi-C-based scaffolding and plot Hi-C contact heat maps.

### step 1

run 01_hic-pro.sh to map raw Hi-C reads to the reference genome, performing a series of analyses to only retain valid read pairs. This step generate Hi-C contact matrix of given resolutions. The pipelines for plotting Hi-C heat maps are also included.

### step 2

run 02_lachesis.sh to call LACHESIS for constructing of chromosome-scale scaffolding.
