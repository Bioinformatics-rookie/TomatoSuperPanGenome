### Tieman et al. 2017 GWAS: pipelines and scripts used for GWAS on the 32 flavor-related metabolits reported in Tieman et al. 2017

### Zhu et al. 2018 GWAS: pipelines and scripts used for GWAS on the 362 metabolits reported in Zhu et al. 2018

The inputs are phenotypic data (content of fruit flavor compounds or metabolites) and genotypic data (SNPs or SVs genotyped in the tomato population).
Output will be association level of each SNP or SV markder to each of these phenotypes.
