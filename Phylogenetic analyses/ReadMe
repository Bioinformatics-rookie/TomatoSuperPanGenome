### phylogeny reconstruction: pipelines and scripts used for building species topology and phylogeny

To infer a species phylogeny, first prepare the amino-acid sequences of the used species (13 tomato and 1 potato here) and extract the single-copy orthologous
genes among these species. Peptide sequences of these single-copy genes are then globally aligned to produce a PHYLIP format result. Maximum likelihood approaches
are then implemented to infer the phylogenetic relationships.

### divergence time estimation: pipelines and scripts used for estimating divergence time among the investigated species

Estimation of divergence time is based on two dataset: one is the inferred phylogeny removing branch lengths and bootstarp values, the other is the alignment
in PHYLIP format excluding any ambiguous positions (N). Fossile calibration points and root age constraint also need to be added to the tree.
