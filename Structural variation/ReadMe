### SV identification: pipelines and scripts used for calling SVs

SV identification contains two section: one is SyRI-based method and the other is based on SVMU. Both take genome assemblies as intput and return identified
potential SVs in the VCF format.

This folder also contains the pipeline to identify SNPs and small InDels. These are extracted from the pair-wise genome alignment by the in-house script.

### SV merge among samples: pipelines and scripts used for mergeing SVs from different samples.

### SV merge with Alonge et al.: pipelines and scripts used for mergeing SVs identified in this study and those in Alonge et al 2020 Cell.
