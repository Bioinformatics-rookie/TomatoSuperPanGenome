### SV identification: pipelines and scripts used for calling SVs

SV identification contains two section: one is SyRI-based method and the other is based on SVMU. Both take genome assemblies as intput and return identified
potential SVs in the VCF format.

This folder also contains the pipeline to identify SNPs and small InDels. These are extracted from the pair-wise genome alignment by the in-house script.

### SV merge among samples: pipelines and scripts used for mergeing SVs from different samples.

To merge individual SV vcf to a multi-sample vcf, take these individual vcfs as input and output will be the merged one. This pipeline also contains methods
to handle nearby SVs with highly similar inserted/deleted sequences.

### SV merge with Alonge et al.: pipelines and scripts used for mergeing SVs identified in this study and those in Alonge et al 2020 Cell.

The frist section of this pipeline is for "lifting over" the SVs reported in Alonge et al. (based on SL4.0 reference) to the coordinate system of S. galapagense.
It takes genomes of SL4.0 and S. galapagense, and the SV vcf from Alonge et al. as intput and will generate SV vcf based on the S. galapagense genome coordinates.

The next part is merging the SVs identified in this study and those from Alonge et al. It requires both SV vcfs and reterun a combined vcf.
