### Here contains the pipeline of identification of SVs, SNPs and InDels

run 01_SyRI SV.sh to call SyRI to identify SVs from genome pair-wise alignments

run 02_SVMU SV.sh to call SVMU to identify SVs from genome pair-wise alignments

run 03_SNP INDEL.sh to extract SNPs and InDels from genome pair-wise alignments
